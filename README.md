Code kata exercises using Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Motivation
**Clean Code** by Uncle Bob: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj&ab_channel=UnityCoin

### TDD process as discussed in the Clean Code lessons:
1. start by writing a unit test first before your program and make it fail
2. write minimum possible code required for your program to make the test pass
3. continue to add more unit tests for differnt incremental inputs so that the tests fail before writing more minimum possible code in your program to make the tests pass
4. whenever dulicate code is found, refactor your program to remove duplicate code before writing more tests

### TDD Principles:
1. your tests should drive your program's code
2. the tests should get more and more specific whereas your program should evolve to become more and more generic
